## **Q1 2026 (January → March)**  
### Focus: Non-EVM Chains

- Onboard **early users** and gather **structured feedback**  
- Release a **frontend view** to allow people to **log in using Socials (e.g., X)** — derive a **deterministic address** using **Chain Signatures (Privy)**

- Introduce **tokenomics** for **$SMOL** — the **voting token** for Smol Bet  
- Use **NEAR Chain Signatures** and **Intents** to extend to **Solana**, **Aptos**, and **SUI**  
- Release the **dispute model** for people to **challenge settled bets**  
- Create a **treasury module** for a **1% protocol fee**

**Goal:** Non-EVM chains with Intents, a frontend to support Smol Bet should be created. Allow people to dispute resolutions.

### Focus: Cross-Chain Campaigns, Feedback & Growth
