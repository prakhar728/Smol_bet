## **Q1 2026 (Jan ‚Üí Mar) ‚Äî Solana Research & Prototype**  

**Product Goals**  
- üöÄ Begin **research and design** for Smol Bet on **Solana**.  
- Prototype a **basic escrow contract** on Solana testnet.
- Launch a **minimal viable version** of Smol Bet on Solana devnet.  


**Technical Goals**  
- Build a **treasury module** for the 1% protocol fee.  
- Deep dive into **Solana runtime & account structure** for escrow logic.  
- Explore **Anchor framework** for program development.  
- Build an early **bet_parser integration** that outputs Solana-compatible instructions.  
- Research Solana **indexing/observability tools** (Helius, RPC infra).  
- Set up a **local validator + CI pipeline** for Solana program testing.  

---

## **Q2 2026 (Apr ‚Üí Jun) ‚Äî MVP Testing, Feedback & Promotion**  

**Product Goals**  
- Run **cross-chain campaigns** on both **Solana devnet** and **Base mainnet** to attract early users.  
- Actively **promote Smol Bet within Solana and Base communities** (CT, Farcaster, Solana ecosystem).  
- Onboard a group of **early testers** and run structured feedback loops.  
- Iterate on UX (bet creation flow, notifications, bet history).  
- Begin **sponsored or community-driven bet campaigns** to test engagement.  

**Technical Goals**  
- Refine **Solana escrow program** based on tester feedback.  
- Enhance **treasury module** for transparent fee accounting.
