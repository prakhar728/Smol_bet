# Smol Bet â€” Project One-Pager

## Vision  
Make casual peer-to-peer bets **trustless, simple, and fun**.  
Smol Bet enables anyone to turn informal wagersâ€”tweets, chats, or hot takesâ€”into **on-chain escrows** with lightweight resolution powered by AI and secure agents.  

---

## Problem  
- Casual bets today (e.g., over Telegram or Twitter) are **unenforceable** â€” often forgotten or disputed.  
- Existing prediction markets (Polymarket, Omen) are **complex, illiquid, or manipulated by whales**.  
- Regulatory ambiguity makes centralized platforms fragile, inaccessible, or geo-blocked.  

---

## Solution  
Smol Bet provides:  
- **Multi-chain escrow contracts** (Aurora Testnet, NEAR, Solana in future).  
- **AI-assisted resolution** via TEE + Shade agents for fair, private outcomes.  
- **Lightweight UX** â€” create or accept a bet from a tweet, chat, or simple dApp flow.  

---

## Differentiators  
- **Trustless:** Funds are escrowed and released automatically.  
- **Lightweight:** Optimized for small, social bets â€” not markets dominated by speculators.  
- **Adjacent to NEAR/Aurora:** Uses cutting-edge infra like **Phala TEE + Shade Agent** for verifiable, private resolution.  
- **Community-first:** Designed for fun, friendly wagers with a clear onramp for early testers.

## Roadmap Highlights (Oct 2025)  
- **Aurora Testnet:** Full create â†’ accept â†’ resolve flow live.  
- **Testing & Leaderboard:** Track user activity, ensure bet lifecycle works end-to-end.  
- **NEAR AI Agent R&D:** Integrate TEE-based Shade agent for resolution.  
- **Backup & Continuity:** Enable bets to be resumed/recovered.  
- **Next Phase:** Prototype expansion to Solana, more robust AI arbitration.  

---

## Call to Action  
- **Test:** Try Smol Bet on Aurora Testnet and share feedback.  
- **Contribute:** Help improve contracts, agents, and UX.  
- **Follow Along:** Stay updated on progress and join early experiments.
