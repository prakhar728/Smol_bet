# **Smol Bet — Agentic Betting, Cross-Chain by Design**

**Smol Bet** is an **agentic betting platform** that transforms social posts into on-chain wagers.  
Built using the **Shade Agents Framework**, it enables users to create, join, and resolve bets directly on **X (Twitter)** — without intermediaries, custodians, or centralized systems.  

Funds are securely managed through **NEAR Chain Signatures**, ensuring verifiable multi-chain deposits, while **NEAR AI** automatically verifies outcomes and settles bets transparently.  
Smol Bet brings **trustless, AI-driven, and social-native betting** to the Web3 ecosystem.

> **Verifiable stakes. AI-enforced outcomes. Automated payouts.**

## **The Problem**
Social bets are everywhere — crypto price predictions, sports debates, or friendly dares — but they’re **unenforceable, unverifiable, and easily forgotten**. 

Social and onchain betting today faces several core challenges:

* Centralized platforms require trust in intermediaries or custodians.
* Cross-chain participation is complex and fragmented.
* Manual resolution of bets often leads to disputes and bias.
* Poor UX and slow onboarding prevent mainstream adoption

## **How Smol Bet Solves It**
1. **Detects bets on X** using an autonomous **Shade Agent**.  
2. **Parses terms** with an AI-powered `bet_parser`.  
3. **Generates non-custodial deposit addresses** using **NEAR Chain Signatures**.  
4. **Automates resolution** via **NEAR AI**, enforcing payouts trustlessly.
